<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Fog and low-visibility conditions make it difficult for drivers to see vehicles,
pedestrians, animals and hazards like potholes, leading to accidents.
Existing systems like cameras or headlights fail in dense fog, and advanced
safety systems are expensive or limited to specific vehicles.
</p>

<p>
This project proposes <b>UniSafe</b>, a low-cost, universal AI-based road safety system
that can be fitted to existing vehicles. Using radar, ultrasonic sensors and an IMU,
UniSafe detects obstacles and road hazards in real time, prioritizes risk and alerts
drivers through audio and visual signals.
</p>

<p>
UniSafe improves road safety, reduces accidents in foggy conditions and supports
safer, sustainable transportation for all.
</p>
